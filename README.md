# Module_12_Credit Risk Analysis Report

## Overview of the Analysis
* Purpose: The purpose of this credit risk analysis report is to determine and discover individuals that would deemed appropriate to open a line of credit. 
* Financial Information: The information gathered to make this assessment includes borrower's income, debt-to-income ratio, number of accounts, total debt, loan size, interest rate, and derogatory remarks.
* Variables - One specific variable that we be used to separate or x and y value is loan status
* Machine Learning Process - This project will utilize the Logistic Regression Model to perform the analysis
* Methods - Initial the model is selected and built. Then the model will have to be fit, trained, and test before the model used with real data.

## Results
* Machine Learning Model 1:
* Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall Scores
* Model 1 had a balanced accuracy score of 0.952 which means that model was good at predicting a certain classification in and unbalanced dataset. In addition, Model1 scored high in precision and recall of the first variable at 1.00 and 0.99 respectively.  However, did not do as well with the second variable.
  
* Machine Learning Model 2:
* Decription of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall Scores
* Model 2 had a balanced accuracy score of 0.99.36 which means that model was very good at predicting a certain classification in and unbalanced dataset. In addition, Model2 scored high in precision and recall of the first variable at 1.00 and 0.99 respectively and had improved results for the second varialbe.
  
## Summary
Overall both models proved had positive results in the abitlity to idenify the desired variable. These models appear to be a good tool detect appropriate candidates who desire lines of credit.
